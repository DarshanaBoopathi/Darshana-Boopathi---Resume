        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have worked a few jobs over the past two years. I have experience working under someone and also leading a team. It has given me great exposure as to how both sides work. My first job was at a tutor company called Kumon, I was a ‚Äúgrader‚Äù. This job just had me correct papers and occasionally help answer kids' questions with basic math and reading.I also from time to time was told to teach preschool/kindergarteners. These kids needed a little more attention and aid to focus to complete their classwork, so that is what I would do. I also worked as the chief marketing officer for a small company called ‚ÄúParty in a Box‚Äù. I can now say I had experience with the creative and analytical side of a company.I had to really be creative and come up with ideas that would help our company gain exposure. I had to really think from the point of view of the customer. This job allowed me to hold events to create exposure or my team and get the word out there that we were a company. I also needed to be hands on and at times do ‚Äúdoor to door sales‚Äù.<br><br>

        My next job was being the CEO of a company called ‚ÄúCharm Jewelry‚Äù This job allowed me to lead a team and work with various aspects of a business. I had to make sure we were organized as a business but at the same time moving forward. This gave me great experience with teamwork and managing other people, it is a lot different leading than it is simply following instructions. It made me work on my organizational skills and communication skills. I had to be comfortable with being stern but also balance with a positive enjoyable attitude so my team felt happy and comfortable in our workspace. <br><br>
  
        The job I currently work at is chipotle. I am a line worker, which means my main job is to serve down the line. It also comes with other factors such as restocking the food, keeping the line clean, mopping/sweeping, making chips etc. This is my first job in a corporation. It is definitely the first job I've had with a physical labor aspect. It teaches me how to be fast paced and always attentive.  It is fascinating to see the business aspect of how one branch ties in with the entire thing.I get to see how my branch is managed and the work that goes into organizing a group of people every week just to make sure the place does not fall apart. Time managing and understanding there are going to be a lot of back breaking hours in order to reach my goal is a big part of this. It's a job that requires consistency and stamina. All the jobs i have had in the past two years definitely have taught me different aspects of the working field and have helped me better myself and improve just as a person
